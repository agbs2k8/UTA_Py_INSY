', u'When your volunteer application is approved, you will receive a BSA membership card that includes your member ID number.', u' ', u'The Boy Scouts of America places the greatest importance on creating the most secure environment possible for our youth members. To maintain such an environment, the BSA developed numerous procedural and leadership selection policies and provides parents and leaders with resources for the ', u'Cub Scout', u', ', u'Boy Scout', u', and ', u'Venturing', u' programs.', u'Leadership Selection ', u'The Boy Scouts of America takes great pride in the quality of our adult leadership. Being a leader in the BSA is a privilege, not a right. The quality of the program and the safety of our youth members call for high-quality adult leaders. We work closely with our chartered organizations to help recruit the best possible leaders for their units.', u'The adult application requests background information that should be checked by the unit committee or the chartered organization before accepting an applicant for unit leadership. While no current screening techniques exist that can identify every potential child molester, we can reduce the risk of accepting a child molester by learning all we can about an applicant for a leadership position\\u2014his or her experience with children, why he or she wants to be a Scout leader, and what discipline techniques he or she would use.', u'Required Training', u'Youth Protection training is required for all BSA registered volunteers.', u' ', u'Youth Protection training must be taken every two years.

', u'Mandatory Report of Child Abuse', u'All persons involved in Scouting shall report to local authorities any good-faith suspicion or belief that any child is or has been physically or sexually abused, physically or emotionally neglected, exposed to any form of violence or threat, exposed to any form of sexual exploitation, including the possession, manufacture, or distribution of child pornography, online solicitation, enticement, or showing of obscene material. You may not abdicate this reporting responsibility to any other person.', u'Steps to Reporting Child Abuse', u'Ensure the child is in a safe environment.

In addition, if the suspected abuse is in the Scout's home or family, you are required to contact the local child abuse hotline. \", u'Notify the Scout executive or his/her designee.

These policies primarily protect youth members; however, they also serve to protect adult leaders. Parents and youth using these safeguards outside the Scouting program further increase the safety of their youth. Scout leaders in positions of youth leadership and supervision outside the Scouting program will find these policies help protect youth in those situations as well.', u'Two-deep leadership on all outings required', u'. A minimum of two registered adult leaders, or one registered leader and a participating Scout\\u2019s parent, or another adult is required for all trips and outings. One of these adults must be 21 years of age or older.', u'Patrol Activities', u'There are instances, such as patrol activities, when the presence of adult leaders is not required and adult leadership may be limited to patrol leadership training and guidance. With proper training, guidance, and approval by troop leaders, the patrol can conduct day hikes and service projects.', u'Adult Supervision/Coed Activities', u'Male and female adult leaders must be present for all overnight coed Scouting trips and outings, even those including parent and child. Both male and female adult leaders must be 21 years of age or older, and one must be a registered member of the BSA.', u'One-on-one contact between adults and youth members is prohibited. ', u'In situations requiring a personal conference, such as a Scoutmaster conference, the meeting is to be conducted with the knowledge and in view of other adults and/or youth.', u'Two-deep leadership and no one-on-one contact between adults and youth members includes digital communication.', u' Leaders may not have one-on-one private online communications or engage one-on-one in other digital activities (games, social media, etc.) with youth members. Leaders should copy a parent and another leader in digital and online communication, ensuring no one-on-one contact exists in text, social media, or other forms of online or digital communication.', u'Age-appropriate and separate accommodations for adults and Scouts are required. ', u'Tenting', u'No adult may share a tent with the opposite sex unless he or she is that adult\\u2019s spouse.', u'No youth may share a tent with an adult or a person of the opposite sex other than a family member or guardian. Assigning youth members more than two years apart in age to sleep in the same tent should be avoided unless the youth are relatives. ', u'Shower Facilities', u'Whenever possible, separate shower and latrine facilities should be provided for male/female adults and male/female youth. If separate facilities are not available, separate shower times should be scheduled and posted.', u'The buddy system should be used at all times. ', u'The buddy system is a safety measure for all Scouting activities. Buddies should know and be comfortable with each other. Self-selection with no more than two years age or significant differences in maturity should be strongly encouraged. When necessary, a buddy team may consist of three Scouts. No youth should be forced into or made to feel uncomfortable by a buddy assignment.', u'Privacy of youth is respected', u'. Adult leaders and youth must respect each other\\u2019s privacy, especially in situations such as changing clothes and taking showers at camp. Adults may enter youth changing or showering areas only to the extent that health and safety requires. Adults must protect their own privacy in similar situations.', u'Inappropriate use of smart phones, cameras, imaging, or digital devices is prohibited. ', u'Although most Scouts and leaders use cameras and other imaging devices responsibly, it is easy to unintentionally or inadvertently invade the privacy of other individuals with\\xa0such devices. The use of any device capable of recording or transmitting visual images in or near shower houses, restrooms, or other areas where privacy is expected is inappropriate.', u'No secret organizations.', u' The BSA does not recognize any secret organizations as part of its program. All aspects of the Scouting program are open to observation by parents and leaders.', u'Youth leadership is monitored by adult leaders', u'. Adult leaders must monitor and guide the leadership techniques used by youth leaders and ensure BSA policies are followed.', u'Discipline must be constructive', u'. Discipline used in Scouting must be constructive and reflect Scouting\\u2019s values. Corporal punishment is never permitted. Disciplinary activities involving isolation, humiliation, or ridicule are prohibited. Examples of positive discipline include verbal praise and high fives.', u'Appropriate attire is required for all activities', u'. Proper clothing for activities is required.', u'No hazing', u'.

', u'Adult leaders in Scouting units are responsible for monitoring the behavior of youth members and other leaders and interceding when necessary.

Advances in technology are enabling new forms of social interaction that extend beyond the appropriate use of cameras or recording devices (see \\u201cScouting's Barriers to Abuse\\u201d). Sending sexually explicit photographs or videos electronically or \\u201csexting\\u201d by cell phones is a form of texting being practiced primarily by young adults and children as young as middle-school age. Sexting is neither safe, nor private, nor an approved form of communication and can lead to severe legal consequences for the sender and the receiver. Although most campers and leaders use digital devices responsibly, educating them about the appropriate use of cell phones and cameras would be a good safety and privacy measure. To address cyber-safety education, the BSA has introduced the age- and grade-specific Cyber Chip program, which addresses topics including cyberbullying, cell-phone use, texting, blogging, gaming, and identity theft. \", u'Check it out', u'.
