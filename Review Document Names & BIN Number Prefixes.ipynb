       "{u'Content': u'Enterprise Risk Management Committee Guidebook The BSA\\u2122s Commitment to Safety We want you to know that the safety of our youth, volunteers, staff, and employees is an important part of the Scouting experience. Youth develop traits of citizenship, character, fitness, and leadership during age-appropriate events when challenged to move beyond their normal comfort level, and discover their abilities. This is appropriate when risks are identified and mitigated. The Scouting program, as contained in our handbooks and literature, integrates many safety features. However, no policy or procedure will replace the review and vigilance of trusted adults and leaders at the point of program execution. Commit yourself to creating a safe and healthy environment by: Knowing and executing the BSA program as contained in our publications Planning tours, activities, and events with vigilance using the tools provided Setting the example for safe behavior and equipment use during program Engaging and educating all pa rticipants in discussions about hazards and risks Reporting incidents in a timely manner Thank you for being part of the Scouting movement and creating an exciting and safe experience for every participant. This BSA safety statement can be customized w ith your council\\u2122s name or photo. Go to http://www.scouting.org/Home/HealthandSafety/SafetyThoughts/1192016.aspx . 680-026 2016 Revision The Boy Scouts of America\\u2122s national Key 3: Chief Scout Executive Michael Surbaugh, President Dr. Robert M. Gates, and Commissioner Tico Perez. Introduction The concep t of enterprise risk management (ERM) is becoming the preferred model for council committee structure in what was previously undertaken as either Health and Safety , or Risk Management. It is consistent with concepts found in the BSA\\u2122s Strategic Plan , and s ince 2013, each council provide s the name of the ERM chair on the council\\u2122s Local Council Charter and Membership Validation . In this revised second e dition, we attempt to incorporate the lessons from almost four years of use, consolidate sections , and \\u0160most importantly \\u0160provide a framework for programs that have worked successfully for councils in their quest to protect people, council property , and the environment. This guidebook is dedicated to the volunteers who give their time, talents , and treasure to pr ovide a fun and safe program for all participants . What Is ERM? Enterprise risk management is a disciplined approach that enables an organization to identify, evaluate, analyze, monitor, and mitigate the risks that threaten the achievement of the organiz ation\\u2122s strategic objectives. Every organization is susceptible to risk in many different areas : operational, market, legal, environmental, reputational, brand, liability , financial , and property . While not exhaustive , this guide is an attempt to provide a framework for the council \\u2122s enterprise risk management committee as it attempt s to address issues in an organized approach . In many councils, there has existed at least one committee on the official council organization chart that served the roles of he alth, safety , risk management , and sometimes Youth Protection . If your council has adopted one committee, two committees , or some other structure, the tasks can be carried out by council leaders who have the specific skills and subject matter expertise nee ded to provide leadership for a fun and safe Scouting experience. For the purposes of this guide, the term enterprise risk management (ERM) has been adopted for the committee that serves two rol es: risk management, and health and safety. The ERM Commi ttee: Vision, Mission, and Potential Responsibilities The adventure of Scouting often includes a certain level of real or implied risk. Rather than diminish the thrill of new experiences, ERM committee members should assist those executing the Scouting pr ogram in recognizing risks and hazards . Vision The Enterprise Risk Management Committee will be an advocate for the safety, health, and well -being of all participants in council Scouting programs; a demonstrated leader promoting safety and healthy beha viors; and a resource advancing competent risk assessment and anticipation of hazards in council programs, activities, and services. Mission The pur pose of the ERM Committee is to Advance and provide local leadership for identifying, reducing , or elimin atin g known or foreseeable hazards and risks . Promote risk assessment for programs, activities , and services. Promote preparedness as well as physic al and mental fitness for youth and adults. Maintain a body of knowledge on health, safety , and risk issues in the council . Potential Responsibilities No two committees are identical and no council has the same challenges. A council with a single camp and a few outdoor program elements will require a different committee than one with multiple camps, facilitie s, and high -adventure programs. This list is not exhaustive and does not suggest requirements. It is only intended to stimulate discussion and to help local councils identify needs or opportunities in the following categories: Safety Use program hazar d analysis, checklists, and safety PAUSE in planning new, modified, or expanded activities, or coach others on how this is done. Promote risk assessment \\u0160down to the unit level \\u0160that incorporates these tools. Identify, assess, and resolve hazards in program activities. This should be done for new, modified, or expanded activities as well as existing programs that have newly recognized hazards. Identify trends and hazards in the council\\u2122s Scouting program that threaten health and safety, and provide guidance w hen emergencies occur. Develop or promote the use of Safety Moments and Safety Incident Reviews at meetings, monthly roundtables, and other appropriate forums. Support and develop systems to ensure the timely reporting of incidents. Review data on known i njuries, illnesses, and accidents to identify trends . Share the lessons learned , and update prevention strategies in the council. Assist the council Key 3 with health, safety, and risk -management issues, and develop a councilwide commitment to safety. Pro gram Support Promote preparedness, personal health, and physical and mental fitness. Support internal groups, committees, panels, and task forces by providing health and safety expertise to advance their mission and goals. Assist with health and safety le adership at councilwide events including camporees, conferences, seminars, and universities of Scouting. Help conduct precamp/postcamp inspections, assist with training of camp health officers, and serve as a liaison between camps and local medical facilit ies. Manage effective implementation of BSA national camp standards such as PD -111 and PD -112. Develop camp policies and standing orders related to health and safety. (See the current edition of National Camp Accreditation Program: National Camp Standards, No. 430 -056.) Monitor or review tour and activity plans as they are submitted. Review service projects for any risks to participants as well as those benefiting from each project When appropriate, work with organizations outside the BSA to advance health and safety efforts. Medical Leadership Coordinate first aid/medical care at events sponsored at the council and district levels. Assist health lodge leadership at councilwide events. Plan and review the operation of summer camp health lodges: supplies, t reatment records, and staff training by the council health supervisor. Oversee maintenance of camper medical records by camp health officers and the council health supervisor, in compliance with privacy standards. Conduct an overview of annual programs to ensure health and wellness are incorporated. Evaluate risks associated with health issues \\u0160such taking childhood obesity into account when planning summer camp menus. Develop and distribute up -to-date resources on first aid, CPR/AED, and emergency medical r esponse. Make sure to include training in BSA Wilderness First Aid from certified or qualified instructors and instructor -trainers at the council, district, and unit levels. Risk Management Prepare a council \\u2122s risk -assessment matrix, evaluating and prior itizing risks identified by volunteers and professional staff. Include in the matrix each type of risk: financial, operational, market, legal, environmental, reputational, brand, liability, and property. See Appendix 1, Section 4.1. Work with other commi ttees to periodically evaluate and recommend changes to the council\\u2122s insurance coverage. Maintain \\u0160with the council executive staff \\u0160an understanding of BSA insurance programs for the local council. Conduct comprehensive insurance reviews in critical areas including properties and business interruption coverage. Identify and address any workplace safety issues that exist for year -round staff and seasonal camp staff. Integrate ERM concepts into all levels of the council\\u2122s programs and activities. Identify con sultants who can assist the council in health and safety, risk management, crisis communications, and related areas. Evaluate and address existing or potential environmental issues. Review council operations in relation to those issues and compliance with local, state, and federal requirements. Training Support Train others in ERM principles and practice, particularly risk identification techniques. Develop a training plan for teaching all leaders in the council to reduce risk. Distribute information abou t policies and procedures developed by the National Council and local council regarding safety and loss prevention. Help council, district, and unit leaders \\u0160as well as youth members \\u0160to remain alert to safety guidelines. Work to keep all council structures (including district and unit levels) informed of BSA policies and procedures, requirements, and recommendations related to health and safety, fitness, and emergency preparedness. Develop and manage a cadre of instructors and trainers for health and safety courses in the council. Help the council develop and implement these courses, and support youth and leader awareness of safety concerns and risk avoidance. Assist and educate local professional staff in identifying and logging incidents in the incident rep orting system. Teach seminars at the Cub Scout leader pow -wow, university of Scouting, College of Commissioner Science, and other organized training events. Develop a communications plan to keep leaders at all levels in the council updated on ERM issues. Relationships With Other Committees/Organizations ERM Committee members should work within the council structure with other council committees as well as unit and district leadership . The following considerations may be helpful : In some councils , the ERM chair is a board -level position within the council structure . It other cases, it is an executive board position , or the chai r reports to a board position. A supportive staff advisor is also a vital part of a successful ERM committee. ERM committees may work with program, camping, aquatics, COPE and climbing, shooting sports, properties, and t raining committee s on a regular basis and in a supporting role. Commissioner staff at the council, district, and unit level can help leaders to understand and execu te the BSA program as designed. They may also share ERM findings at roundtables and be a resource for sharing support materials such as the annual health and medical record, tour -and-activity planning information, the Sweet 16 of BSA Safety, and the Guide to Safe Scouting . In some councils, district ERM chairs are the foundation of the council committee. While there is no mandate for this structure, having these local representatives may be beneficial. Finally, the ERM committee may wish to establish collab orative relationships with other non -profit or mission -driven service and professional organizations. The American Red Cross, the American Society of Safety Engineers, and others can provide knowledge, expertise, and manpower aligned with the committee\\u2122s m ission. Committee Members and Their Roles While ERM committees in various councils may be different based on council need and the availability of volunteers, each committee should include the chair, district ERM representatives, various subject -matter ex perts, a staff advisor, and (as needed) members of other council committees. More detailed sample job descriptions for the chair, district ERM representative, and subject -matter expert are provided in appendix 4. Chair This position may be held (when app ropriate and desired) by a member of the council\\u2122 s executive board who has demonstrated ability to lead a group, draft a plan, and communicate effectively with other groups that need input from the ERM Committee. The chair should have expertise in health, safety, or risk management but may also be a Scouter known to have effectively manage d a group toward specific objectives. The chair is responsible for planning and conducting the regular meetings and communicating the agenda, notes, minutes, and work plan s to the council executive staff advisor assigned to the committee. The chair is responsible for recruiting committee members. The chair should identify and name a co -chair to provide support when the chair is unable to lead a meeting or under some other c ircumstance . A co -chair is also essential to effective succession planning. District ERM Representatives Serve on the ERM Committee as active members. Communicate with the district c hair and key members of the district committee on matters related to hea lth, safety, and risk management. Provide training and advice on matters related to district program. Ensure that the council and district ERM training plans are executed via district roundtables and other meetings. Serve as resources on ERM matters for un it leaders in their districts and the district committees. Serve as liaison s between the ERM Committee and their districts when an event is being planned. Assist in evaluating risks and potential hazards related to the event. Subject -Matter Experts (SMEs) Subject -matter expert s should meet together regularly and provide specific insight and information to help the ERM Committee accomplish its mission. Each council should select experts to serve based on their availability and their ability to meet specifi c needs. When appropriate, they may be engaged on an ad hoc basis. The list of potential SMEs is long and could include experts in the following areas : Youth protection/children at risk/child abuse Emergency preparedness/ planning ( state and local agencies) Business continuity planning or recovery operations Communications \\u0160crisis communication, PR, publishing Environment al protection General risk management Sanitary , civil, and/or environmental engineering Public health Food safety and sanitation Veterinar y care Information technology backup and security Insurance Legal and regulatory affairs Medical professionals (physician s, nurse s, behavioral health practitioner s, EMT s) Health and safety management Fire and life safety Infection control/ infectious disea ses/CDC standards Organized health care ( hospitals, clinics, medical systems) Recreational industry liaison (e.g., local parks and recreation departments, outdoor retailer) Liaisons with other youth -serving/health and safety/risk management organizations ( e.g., schools, American Red Cross, American Heart Association) Behavioral ( mental) health \\u0160ideally, a crisis response team coordinator who has special skills or can access others with a variety of required skills Search and r escue Scuba (PADI , et al) First aid/emergency medical response/risk management t raining Staff Advisor Meet s regularly with the chair and the full committee to provide support and resources. Communicates with district directors , district executives , and others on the council executive staff . Assist s in communicating the message of the BSA ERM group to the executive board and other key leaders. Serves as a key resource for updating national BSA literature and references. Connects the ERM Committee chair with appropriate resources at the national office. Provides materials for distribution to professional staff and access to information found on MyBSA and other professional sites. Serves as a l iaison to staff advisors on other council committees (i.e., aquatics, camping, climbing, propert ies, finance, t raining, advancement, commissioner service) . Coordinates with other council committees to avoid duplication and confusion. Communicates information to the committee regarding enterprise risk management policies . Promote s knowledge and use of risk management resources by professionals and volunteers. Summary and Conclusions So what are the outcomes of participating in all of this work? The BSA mission and vision will be met, risks will be mitigated, and youth will be able to enjoy the Scout ing program with fewer injuries and illnesses. In addition, the council may benefit from a reduction in insurance rates. What Scouting achieves, in the end, is directly related to how well the committee comes together to make things safer for the youth a nd volunteers . Dr. James West, the BSA\\u2122s first Chief Scout Executive , put it best in his foreword to the Local Council Manual: Health and Safety, published in 1940. Though the words we use today are a bit less formal, the message and our objective remain the same \\u0160safer, happier , and healthier youth: \\ufb01I know of no more important service that Scouting can render than, through its leadership, to create early in the life of the boy a sense of individual responsibility for making and keeping himself physically fit, reducing to a minimum the probability of his being handicapped through accident, reducing to a minimum the likelihood of his life being carried on with unhappiness because he does not know how to live . \\ufb01So many things are the result of lack of carefu l planning, lack of careful thinking through, thoughtlessness . And the health and safety practices of Scouting, we hope, are going to help boys to plan more definitely to avoid accident and illness, and to prepare themselves i n a positive way to face life. \\ufb02 Appendix 1: BSA Risk Assessment Strategies and Tools 1. Introduction This document was developed to provide Scouters with the necessary strategies and tools to assess risks within the Scouting program. The need to assess risk and its potential impacts on the program is stated in the Guide to Safe Scouting : \\ufb01In situations not specifically covered in this guide, activity planners should evaluate the risk or potential risk of harm, and respond with action plans based on common sense, community standards, the Boy Scout motto, and safety policies and practices commonly prescribed for the activity by experienced providers and practitioners.\\ufb02 No organization, including the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), can develop a comprehensive set of guidelines or procedure s that will cover all possible risks. The BSA has already identified the need to address specific high -risk programs such as aquatics and shooting sports. In these instances, clear guidance is given through Safe Swim Defense /Safety Afloat, BSA National Sho oting Sports Manual , and Belay on . However, when activities and programs fall outside Scouting guidelines, the responsibility of identifying, evaluating, and executing a safe program belongs to the Scouting entities wanting to conduct the activity or progr am (e.g., councils, districts, units, etc.). 1.1. What Is a Risk Assessment? A risk assessment is a review of what could go wrong, the potential impact when things do go wrong, and how to eliminate or lessen the risk. 1.2. Hazards and Risks A hazard is a condition or practice with the potential to cause harm (e.g., extreme heat, riding in a car, etc.). It is vital to identify potential hazards, or we will not be able to assess risks. Risk is the chance that a negative event (e.g., injury, property damage, etc.) wi ll occur if exposed to a hazard. Risk is assessed by looking at two components: probability and severity. Probability is the odds of something occurring. For example, if you flip a penny, the probability that it will end up heads is 50 percent. Severity is the seriousness of the consequences. Consequences can be minor or major. For example, an incident may cause $100 versus $100,000 of property damage. An injury may be a minor scrape versus a broken bone. Looking at risk using probability and severity he lps determine if the risk is acceptable or if changes need to be made. Here\\u2122s what that looks like: PROBABILITY SEVERITY Minor Major Low Bug flies in my eye Falling from a rock wall High Cutting finger at wood carving class Driving while drowsy 1.3. Luck Versus Risk If nothing has been done to prevent risk and a negative event still does not occur, that\\u2122s simply luck. For example, if the probability of a canoe tipping over is 25 percent when someone stands up in the canoe, this means that 75 percent of the time it won\\u2122t tip over. If your canoe hasn\\u2122t tipped over, this doesn\\u2122t mean standing in it is less risky. You\\u2122ve just been lucky! 2. Philosophy 2.1. Subjective Exercise Risk assessing is a subjective exercise. It\\u2122s not uncommon for two different groups to ev aluate risks associated with the same program or activity and end up with a different result. The true power of risk assessments does not come from creating the \\ufb01right\\ufb02 assessment or operating under the belief that all risks will be eliminated. Rather, the value comes from gathering those involved with the program or activity and having discussions about risk and what can be done to address risks. It\\u2122s not about Scouting having \\ufb01no risks.\\ufb02 It\\u2122s about Scouters \\ufb01knowing the risks.\\ufb02 2.2. Controllable Risks Stay fo cused on risks over which you have some degree of control. For example, someone being hurt from a meteor strike at summer camp is possible, but what control do we have over that risk? However, don\\u2122t confuse an inability to control the risk with an unwillin gness to address it. For example, we have no control over lightning strikes during a campout, but we can control the likelihood of being struck by lightning by going inside when a thunderstorm comes. 2.3. Selecting Risk Assessment Tools When it comes to assess ing risk, you need to use the right tool for the job. Some of the tools in this document may require several resources to conduct. Make sure to choose the \\ufb01right -size\\ufb02 tool for your activity. (See Attachment A \\u0152 Risk Assessment Selection Tool.) 2.4. Risk Appet ite Scouting entities will need to determine their risk appetite by choosing what activities they are willing to take on. For example, adult leaders in one troop may be willing to become certified climbing instructors in order to run a safe climbing progra m, but another troop may not want that risk. One council may want to build a BMX bike track and program to deliver to units; another council may be unwilling to take on the potential risk of injuries on the track. 3. Process Scouting entities can assess ris ks by following these steps: Define the scope of the risk assessment Gather the experts Identify, assess and document hazards and risks Decide control measures Routinely review risk assessments 3.1. Define Scope The first step in the process is to clearly and concisely define what you are assessing. For example, \\ufb01Expanded use of pellet guns in a Webelos resident camp program\\ufb02 is clearer than \\ufb01Cub Scout shooting program.\\ufb02 Defining the scope too broadly can make the assessment overwhelming and inefficient. The person who has championed the program should be the one responsible for defining the scope. 3.2. Gather the Experts Risk assessments are best conducted in a group. If you are reviewing changes to the shotgun range at summer camp, you may need Scouting profession als, Shooting Sports Committee members, troop or Venturing crew leaders, NRA instructors, Health and Safety Committee members, etc. 3.3. Identify, Assess, and Document The group should brainstorm potential serious hazards and what the possible consequences ar e if those hazards are not addressed. Documenting potential hazards and risks provides a way to communicate that an assessment was completed. The documentation can also be used to train individuals that are new to the program or activity. 3.4. Decide Control M easures Once risks have been assessed, the group needs to decide if the risks are acceptable or if additional measures need to be implemented. The different methods for doing this are covered in the various tools in this document. 3.5. Review Risk assessments should be reviewed on a routine basis. Keep in mind that things change over time, and the risk assessment should be reviewed and revised accordingly. For example, a troop may have put together a risk assessment last year for their \\ufb01first annual\\ufb02 canoe camp out. However, this year the same spot is not available and a new location is being used. Summer camp program areas should be looked at on an annual basis. 4. Tools The following tools are the preferred way of assessing risks in the Scouting program, but othe r tools used in private industry could be used as well. 4.1. Enterprise Analysis This tool is primarily used to record, assess, and manage councilwide risks. The risks identified using this tool should be serious enough to jeopardize council operations. This t ool may cover many areas, but it should at least address the following risks: Financial Operational Market Legal Environmental Reputation Brand Liability Property 4.2. Program Hazard Analysis This tool is primarily used for program areas within camps or high -adventure bases. It covers specific risks to the program areas. This tool has a defined way of assessing probability and severity of risks. The tool initially assesses risks as if there are no protective measures in place; then you look at the risk again, t his time with the protective measures applied. 4.3. Safety Checklists These tools are used for small events or campouts. Checklists are a \\ufb01body of knowledge\\ufb02 for running Scouting activities safely. Like an airline pilot reviewing a checklist before takeoff, th ese tools help to make sure critical safeguards are in place to ensure a safe Scouting activity. 4.4. Safety PAUSE The Safety PAUSE process stresses the importance of a last -minute safety check in the field. By encouraging each Scout or adult leader to pause and reflect on the tasks at hand just before beginning, you have an opportunity to take necessary precautions to prevent any present or potential hazards. This is not a standalone tool. A formal risk assessment should be done first, such as a safety check list or a program hazard analysis (PHA). \\u0141 PAUSE before you start \\u0141 ASSESS possible hazards \\u0141 UNDERSTAND how to proceed safely \\u0141 SHARE your plan with others \\u0141 EXECUTE the activity safely 5. Acceptance and Resolution of Risk When evaluating risks, it is always dif ficult to determine how much risk to accept. As previously stated, the idea is for Scouters to \\ufb01know risks,\\ufb02 not for Scouting to have \\ufb01no risks.\\ufb02 This is why gathering the experts and having these conversations is so vital. You need to consider differing o pinions and approaches to addressing risks. When determining how to deal with risks, keep in mind that there is a hierarchy of controls. In other words some actions work better than others. Here is the hierarchy, in order of preference: 5.1. Eliminate the Ris k Unfortunately, sometimes the answer to certain risks is to not have them present. This may mean that you will eliminate risky activities or decide not to conduct the program at all. 5.2. Engineer Out the Risk Design the environment so that the risk is elimin ated. This could be as simple as putting a fence around a climbing tower or building a canopy over your shooting ranges. In the first instance, you engineer a protective barrier to eliminate unauthorized access to a high -adventure area. The canopy over the shooting sports area eliminates the hazard of being sunburned. 5.3. Administrative Controls (including work practices) These controls could be written procedures or training. They don\\u2122t eliminate the risk, but they do make Scouters more aware of the potential dangers. Almost all risks will involve some form of administrative control, but you should be leery if this is the only protective measure being taken. 5.4. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Personal protective equipment (e.g., safety glasses, vests, hearin g protection, etc.) is the lowest form of hazard control. Like administrative controls, PPE does not eliminate risks; it simply tries to reduce the severity of a hazard. For example, wearing helmets at a climbing tower do not eliminate the risk of an obje ct falling from the tower and hitting someone on the ground. However, the helmet will help lessen the seriousness of the injury. Program areas will have PPE \\u0160but, again, you should be leery if this is the only protective measure for an activity. 5.5. Advice t o ERM Committees When it comes to evaluating risks, ERM committees should not be the only ones involved in this process. Persons who are asking for activities outside the Scouting program need to be responsible for facilitating the risk review. ERM committ ees should be utilized as advisors or, in essence, the conscience of the Scouting entity. In the business world, safety and health are not the sole responsibility of the \\ufb01safety and health department.\\ufb02 It is also not something that you do in addition to running Scouting activities. We don\\u2122t run \\ufb01a climbing program with some safety and health components\\ufb02 ... we run a safe climbing program. Safety and health is everyone\\u2122s responsibility, and it is led by those at the front line. Approve plans, not ideas. Of ten, when ERM committees are asked to evaluate risks, they are reviewing an idea that someone has suggested. Ideas can only be safely brought to fruition if there is a plan in place. Therefore it should never be the sole responsibility of the ERM Committee to find a way to make the program work. Rather, the originator of the idea should be presenting a well thought -out plan for running the program safely and seeking the committee\\u2122s advice. 6.
